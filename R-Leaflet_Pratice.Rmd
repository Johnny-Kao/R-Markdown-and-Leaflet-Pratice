Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=64.13354845, lng=-21.9224817, popup="Reykjavik, Iceland")
my_map
```

This is R project praticing. The popup is my dream city to live.
